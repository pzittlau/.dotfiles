This is most of my config for Debian Linux.

# Installation

1. Install minimal debian install (without any desktop environment)
2. Optionally setup `/etc/apt/sources.list` for using testing/unstable, testing preferred
3. Clone repo and cd into it
4. Run `./install.sh`
5. Reboot
6. optionally install gpu-drivers

# Other things

The `install.sh` script *can* be used for updating, but it's probably better to do it manually.
